# Logic AI

## Overview

The motivation behind this project is to create a simple language that can be used by three parties:
Humans, Machines and AI.
The language should be simple enough for humans to understand, but also be able to be parsed by machines and AI.

## Motivation

Nowadays, AI is becoming more and more popular, and it is important to have a language that can be understood by both
humans and machines.
It will be easier to eliminate the gap between humans and machines if we have a common language that both can
understand.
AI is already helpful to help humans to write code,
and having a language which even is verbose can be helpful, so all parties can understand the code.

## Goals

1. Create a language that can be understood by humans, machines and AI.
2. This language should be _**simple enough for humans**_ to understand.
3. This language should be able to be _**parsed by machines**_ and AI.
4. This language should be able to _**represent any kind of data**_ (structured/unstructured).
5. This language should be able to _**represent any kind of logic**_.
6. This language should be _**enough verbose**_ to be understood by humans.
7. This language should be _**enough flexible**_ to support _**modularization**_.
8. This language should be _**UI ready**_, so it can be easily _**represented in the UI**_.
